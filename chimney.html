    Preparing Your Home for a Chimney Sweep
Preparing for a chimney sweep in Main Henrico VA
Your fireplace or stove provides warmth and visual appeal to your home. But, they require a lot of work to ensure they work effectively and safely. However, dirty chimneys cause a significant number of house fires every year, and the leading cause of chimney fires is homeowners who fail to clean them.

According to the Chimney Safety Institute of America, there are more than 20,000 chimney fires every year in the United States. Besides fire, smoke byproducts like creosote, birds’ nests, leaves, and other debris stuck in the chimney reduce airflow and circulation, causing carbon monoxide to build up in your home.

Hiring a chimney sweep keeps your fireplace running efficiently and your family safe. However, cleaning can sometimes be a dirty process, as chimney sweeps must remove filthy creosote residue, soot, and the debris mentioned above from the chimney.

So, it’s wise to prepare your home for your chimney sweep so you get the best results, and here are a few tips to consider.

Make Sure the Chimney is Cold
Don’t use your fireplace for 24-48 hours before the chimney sweep’s arrival. Our professionals can’t do a proper cleaning or chimney inspection if the bricks are hot or you have embers in the fireplace.

Clean Off Your Mantle
Most homeowners display valuable heirlooms, photos, or other treasures on their fireplace mantle, so it’s a good idea to remove them for safety while our technicians work.

Our professionals are as careful as possible in your home, but accidents happen, which is why it’s wise to take as many precautions to protect your valuables during an appointment.

Cover Furniture
As mentioned, we do everything in our power to be clean when working in your home; however, it’s nearly impossible to guard against soot particles, especially if your chimney hasn’t been cleaned in a while.

We recommend covering your upholstery with sheets or something you can wash if it gets dirty.

Provide Easy Access to your Fireplace
Our chimney sweep needs clear and easy access to your fireplace to do a proper inspection and cleaning, and they need space for any tools or equipment they bring.

We also ask that you please remove fireplace tools, logs, pet toys or children’s toys, or any other obstructions that might get in the way.

Moreover, our technician will lay down a drop cloth to protect your carpet, so make sure to clear the immediate area around your fireplace.

Tell Your Chimney Sweep About Potential Problems
Before the chimney sweep begins their cleaning and inspection, make them aware of any issues you’ve been having with your fireplace or chimney — issues like foul odors or back puffing.
